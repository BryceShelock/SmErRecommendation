Review Details
Sun Anchen
Date: 2025-04-20
Comments:
"Recommendation algorithm design (content-based + collaborative filtering) is well-structured and aligns with industry best practices.
Suggest adding a fallback mechanism for cold-start users (no booking history) using popular 密室 (escape room) tags as a default recommendation."
FTR Result: Pass (with minor recommendations for cold-start handling).

Comments:
"Database schema for reviews table is efficient. Indexing on script_id and user_id will optimize recommendation query performance."
Qiao Xi
Date: 2025-04-19
Comments:
"API endpoints for recommendations and comments are RESTful and well-documented. Error handling for edge cases (e.g., empty user history) is included."
Final Approval
Approver: Cai Xinyi (Scrum Master, after FTR validation)
Date: 2025-04-20
Comments:
"FTR successfully passed with Sun Anchen’s expert input. Minor recommendations (cold-start fallback) are logged as follow-up tasks (TASK-123). Proceed with implementation."
Implementation Status
 FTR Completed: All reviewers approved the technical design, with Sun Anchen’s feedback incorporated into the algorithm (added cold-start fallback logic).
 Code changes completed (Qiao Xi, 2025-05-05)
 Unit tests written and passed (Cai Xinyi, 2025-05-06)
 Integration tests completed (Scheduled: 2025-05-17)
 Documentation updated (Xu Yixin, 2025-05-07, including FTR review notes)
 Code review completed (Tao Yanerge, 2025-05-08, aligned with FTR feedback)
 Final approval received (Cai Xinyi, 2025-05-08)
Notes
FTR Key Outcome: Sun Anchen’s external review validated the technical feasibility of the recommendation algorithm and improved cold-start handling, enhancing user experience for new users.
Action Item: Cold-start fallback logic (using popular 密室 tags) was added to recommendation/algo.py (commit: a1b2c3d, Qiao Xi, 2025-05-03).
