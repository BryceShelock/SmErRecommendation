## Version Control
### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

### Commit Message Convention
Format: `type(scope): subject`

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat(auth): implement user authentication`

## Change Management Process
1. Create a Change Request (CR) using the template in `docs/templates/change_request_template.md`
2. Get technical review and approval
3. Implement changes in a feature branch
4. Write/update tests
5. Submit pull request
6. Code review
7. Merge to develop branch
8. Deploy to staging
9. Final approval
10. Merge to main branch

## Quality Gates
### Pre-commit Hooks
- No TODO comments
- No debug print statements
- Commit message format check
- Unit tests must pass
- Code coverage must be >= 80%

### Pull Request Requirements
- All tests passing
- Code review approval
- Documentation updated
- No merge conflicts
- Change request approved

## Access Control
### Roles
- Admin: Full access
- Developer: Read/Write access
- Reviewer: Read/Review access
- Tester: Read/Test access

## Build and Deployment
### Environments
- Development
- Staging
- Production

### Deployment Process
1. Automated build
2. Run tests
3. Deploy to staging
4. Manual approval
5. Deploy to production

## Audit and Compliance
- All changes are tracked in Git
- Change requests are documented
- Code reviews are mandatory
- Test coverage is monitored
- Deployment logs are maintained

## Tools and Integration
- Git for version control
- GitHub for code hosting
- CI/CD pipeline (to be configured)
- Code coverage tools
- Static code analysis
